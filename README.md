## Question
ABC LTD is desirous of tracking task assigned to their staff. Each task has specific duration. Multiple tasks can be assigned to a staff, and multiple staff can be assigned to a single task as well. 

1. Create endpoints to manage staff to task assignment.
2. Create enpoints for task tracking per staff

## Solution/What to do
1. **To create endpoints for managing staff to task assignments, we would create endpoints such as:**
      - An endpoint for creating new task and assigning staff members to it.
      - An endpoint for updating or removing a staff member from a task
      - An endpoint for viewing all task assigned to a specific staff.



2. **To create endpoints for task tracking per staff, we could create several endpoints that could do the following:**
    - An endpoint for viewing the progress of a specific task
    - An endpoint for updating the status of a task 
    - An endpoint for viewing all task assigned to a specific staff memmber with their corresponding status.
